Installing all the libraries above is possible directly under Windows, but it is often a massive pain, so we recommend you use WSL--Windows Subsystem for Linux , that is you install a Linux environment \"inside\" your Windows (Win10 or Win11), and use this. Before you continue this tutorial You must first install WSL on your Windows machine. Install GDAL To install GDAL, run the following commands one by one on your Ubuntu terminal: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa && sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install gdal-bin sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev If everything went correct, you've successfully installed GDAL! Install CGAL Let's install CGAL now with the following two commands: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev If everything went correct, you now have CGAL as well! Note Before starting to use GDAL and CGAL on CLion, you will need to complete the following two steps. Install CMake To install CMake, run the following commands on your Ubuntu terminal. Install the libraries that CMake depends on: sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev Go to the tmp directory: cd /tmp Download the source code: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.20.0/cmake-3.20.0.tar.gz When this is complete, extract the file: tar -zxvf cmake-3.20.0.tar.gz Go to the extracted folder: cd cmake-3.20.0 Compile and install CMake: ./bootstrap This may take some time, you should see the following when it is finished. Now run the following command to make it: make This step will also take some time. Once it is finished, you can finally install it: sudo make install Finally, to check if the installation was successful, you can see the CMake version: cmake --version Install GDB GDB is a debugger for C++ and you will need it in CLion to connect to WSL. If you are installing GDB right after CMake, you are probably still in the cmake-3.20.0 folder on your Ubuntu terminal. First, go back to the home directory: cd ../.. Install GDB with the following two commands: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install gdb If this method does not work for you, you can also install it through the source code as explained in the second option on this [page]. You can verify the installation by checking the GDB version: gdb --version Once you install GDB, you now have everything you need to connect to WSL in CLion! Connect to CLion Warning The steps to connect with WSL may change depending on your CLion version. This tutorial uses CLion 2021.3. Go to Settings from File or by simply pressing Ctrl+Alt+S. Under Build, Execution, Deployment , go to Toolchains . Then, add a new toolchain by clicking on the + sign and select WSL. It should automatically detect all the fiels (Toolset, CMake, Debugger etc.). However, if you see an error for CMake that it cannot be found, click on Browse on the right-side of CMake and choose the correct file. You can find it under /usr/local/bin/cmake . After this step, you may see the following warning under C++ compiler: Test cmake run finished with errors . In this case, reboot your WSL by typing the following command on your Ubuntu terminal: wsl.exe -t Ubuntu This will close the terminal. Simply open it again by searching Ubuntu on your device. Now, if you check CLion again, you should not see the warning anymore. Finally, do not forget to make WSL default by placing it on the top of the listed toolchains. You can do this by dragging WSL to the top, or by using the arrows.

Here is how to set this up on a UNIX-like system ( Linux and macOS ). Configuration In your local computer, type ssh-keygen -t ed25519 and follow the instructions. It is recommended to use a password to protect your keys. You'll have to use this password everytime you login after you are done, or you can use ssh-add to store it (once after you restart your computer). Create a file named config in your ~/.ssh folder (or, just vim ~/.ssh/config ) and put the following content: Host bastionex Hostname linux-bastion-ex.tudelft.nl User netid Host godzilla Hostname godzilla.bk.tudelft.nl ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p bastionex User gUsername Host website Hostname 3d.bk.tudelft.nl ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p bastionex User wUsername Replace netid with your netid, gUsername with your username in godzilla and wUsername with your username in the website server. Copy your public key (as created in step 1) to all three servers respectively. So: ssh-copy-id bastionex and give your TU Delft password when prompted. ssh-copy-id godzilla and give your keys password (set in step 1) and then your godzilla password. ssh-copy-id website and your keys password (set in step 1) and then your website password. Beware you might be prompted for the password of your ssh keys multiple times before you are asked for the actual password of the respective user in each server. Usage As soon as your ~/.ssh/config is defined and your public key is copied correctly, you should be able to login to godzilla or the website with the respective commands: - ssh godzilla - ssh website Transferring files We suggest you use rsync command in the terminal for file transfer. To transfer a whole directory to a remote machine, use the following syntax: rsync -azhP foo/bar remote_host:/folder/in/remote/ To transfer contents of a directory, but not the directory itself, add a trailing slash / . For example, to transfer the contents of a directory to 'gilfoyle', you can type rsync -azhP foo/bar/ gilfoyle:/home/myusername/ To transfer a whole directory from a remote to your current directory, type: rsync -azhP remote_host:/folder/in/remote . If you don't have a Host defined in .ssh/config file, you must use username@remote_host identifier as 'remote_host'. Few notes about rsync: It 'synchronizes' files between two computers. This means if two files are the same (name, size, date) it will skip them. Useful when you only want to update the whole folder with new files. In the -azhP options a preserves all information on files from the host, z compresses files before sending, h shows human-readable form, and P allows a continuation of partially transferred files (in case your connection breaks). Comments For students, bastionex is not accesible. They have to request for an account in student-linux.tudelft.nl and then the configuration above should be change to use that hostname instead. On Windows it should be possible to do similar things with puttyssh and puttyagent . Another alternative is to install Windows Subsystem for Linux and some Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu ) and follow the same instructions above.

You shall use only one sentence per line And use one empty line to start a new paragraph. It'll then be easier to track changes in Git, since these are line-based. I like to create buffers in ArcGIS. But it is not always possible as it often crashes. Also, ... 2. You shall use natbib for citations and the commands \\citet{} (cite in the text as a noun) \\citep{} (cite between parentheses). \\usepackage [round] { natbib } ... \\citet { Smith00 } succeeded in creating a buffer. However, it has been shown that it is not an easy task~ \\citep { Brown90 } . 3. You shall prevent breaking lines with \"~\" when referencing and citing In Section~ \\ref { sec:intro } , we can observe that the buffer was a success~ \\citep { Smith99 } . 4. You shall use one - for an hyphen, two -- for a range between numbers, and three --- for a punctuation in a sentence I like---unlike my father---to build multi-dimensional models, especially those made in 1990--1995. 5. You shall give meaningful labels A figure's label should start with fig: and a section's label with sec: \\section { Introduction } \\label { sec:intro } In recent years, buffers have been rather complex to implement because ... 6. You shall put a short space after e.g. and i.e. with the use of a backslash The following two commands shall thus be used: \\newcommand { \\ie }{ i.e. } \\newcommand { \\eg }{ e.g. } ... Buffers can be generated on different geometries, \\eg\\ points, polylines and polygons. 7. You shall put all figures/graphs in a single subfolder ( figs/ ) And you shall put the source file (eg IPE , OmniGraffle, Illustrator, etc.) there as well for future use. You can then use this to specify the relative path for all figures (it refers to the figure ./figs/potato.pdf ): \\graphicspath {{ figs/ }} \\includegraphics [width=0.95\\linewidth] { potato.pdf } 8. In your BibTeX file, you shall use curly brackets for words/letters you want to have capitalised in the title The other fields are not affected by this.
